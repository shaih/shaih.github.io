<b> Abstract: </b> 
We study the problem of <i>partial key exposure</i>. Standard 
cryptographic definitions and constructions do not guarantee any 
security even if a tiny fraction of the secret key is compromised. 
We show how to build cryptographic primitives that remain secure 
even when an adversary is able to learn <i>almost all</i> of the 
secret key.
</P>

<P>
The key to our approach is a new primitive of independent interest, 
which we call an <i>Exposure-Resilient Function</i> (ERF) -- a 
deterministic function whose output appears random (in a perfect, 
statistical or computational sense) even if almost all the bits of 
the input are known. ERF's by themselves efficiently solve the partial 
key exposure problem in the setting where the secret is simply a random 
value, like in private-key cryptography. They can also be viewed as very 
secure pseudorandom generators, and have many other applications.
</P>

<P>
To solve the general partial key exposure problem, we use the
(generalized) notion of an <i>All-Or-Nothing Transform</i> (AoNT), an
invertible (randomized) transformation <i>T</i> which, nevertheless,
reveals "no information" about <i>x</i> even if almost all the bits
of <i>T(x)</i> are known.  By applying an AoNT to the secret key of 
any cryptographic system, we obtain security against partial key exposure.
To date, the only known security analyses of AoNT candidates were made 
in the random oracle model.
We show how to construct ERF's and AoNT's with nearly optimal
parameters. Our computational constructions are based on any one-way
function. We also provide several applications and additional
properties concerning these notions.
