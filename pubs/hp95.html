<b> Abstract: </b> 
We study a natural problem in secure systems, namely - 
storing classified files on-line. A system of classified files contains 
a set of files (or documents), a set of users, and an authorization 
structure which defines the subset of files each user is authorized to 
see. We want a user in the system to be able to see every file in her 
``authorized list'' but not any other file.
<p>

We present definitions of secure classified file systems and discuss 
various aspects of such systems, such as static versus dynamic models, 
resilience, the role of a central trusted entity, etc. 
We also present a highly space-efficient implementation for a secure 
system which is based on RSA.
