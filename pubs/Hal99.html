<b> Abstract: </b> 
In this paper we address the problem of constructing commitment 
schemes where the sender is bounded to polynomial time and the 
receiver may be all powerful. Many known constructions for such 
commitment schemes are based on the hardness of factoring large integers.
However, these schemes typically use integers of a special form and 
thus require a rather expensive initialization procedure for establishing 
these special-form integers. In this paper we present a scheme which is 
based on the hardness of factoring large integers but avoids the need of 
a complex initialization procedure.
