<b>Abstract: </b> 
In this work, we design secure multiparty computation capabili-
ties into the permissioned blockchain architecture of Hyperledger
Fabric and use them to implement the clearing price mechanism
for IPOs. Fabric is a platform for "blockchain for business,"
providing a robust mechanism for a set of "peers" to jointly maintain a
distributed immutable ledger. As with any blockchain, using confi-
dential data on the ledger is a challenge, and we use cryptographic
secure multiparty computation (MPC) to address this challenge.
The use of secure MPC to enable confidential data on blockchains
was proposed before, but this approach only now begins to find its
way to real-life systems. In particular, ours is the first attempt to
integrate it in a complex blockchain environment such as Fabric.
<p>
To enable this approach, we integrated mechanisms into Fabric
to let the peers access local information such as their respective
keys, and also send messages to each other while executing smart
contracts. We added to Fabric a library that implements the required
cryptographic tools, and made it accessible from the smart contract.
We then designed an efficient cryptographic protocol for the IPO
clearing price mechanism, and used our integrated system to run
it on Fabric. Although not fully optimized yet, the performance
of the resulting implementation is more than fast enough for this
particular application, ranging from 8 to 23 seconds to execute an
IPO sale.</p>
