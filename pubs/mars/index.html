<h2>The MARS cipher - IBM submission to AES</h2>

May 19, 2000: Here is the latest version of our
<A HREF="final-comments.pdf">"final comments"</A>. Also, here are two
technical notes: one about <A HREF="linear.pdf">linear analysis</A>
and the other about <A HREF="key-agil.pdf">key-agility</A>.

<P>
August 11, 1999: 
MARS was chosen as a finalist in the AES selection process. A 
suggested "tweak" in the key-setup routine of MARS was accepted 
by NIST.  A  <A HREF="key-setup.txt">pseudocode</A> of the new 
key-setup routine is available here. Also, you can find here the 
<A HREF="test-vectors/index.html">new test vectors</A> for MARS.

<p>
MARS is a shared-key (symmetric) block cipher, supporting 128-bit blocks 
and variable key size. It is designed to take advantage of the powerful 
operations supported in today's computers, resulting in a much improved 
security/performance tradeoff over existing ciphers.  
As a result, MARS offers better security than triple DES while running 
significantly faster than single DES. 
<p>
The current C implementation runs at rates of about 65 Mbit/sec. on a 
200 MHz Pentium-Pro, and 85 Mbit/sec. on a 200 MHz PowerPC. In hardware, 
MARS can achieve a 10X speedup factor. Still, both hardware and software 
implementations of MARS are remarkably compact, and easily fit on a 
smartcard and in other limited-resource environments. 
<p>
The combination of high security, high speed, and flexibility, makes MARS 
an excellent choice for the encryption needs of the information world well 
into the next century.
