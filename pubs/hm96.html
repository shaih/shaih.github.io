<b> Abstract: </b> 
We present a very practical string-commitment scheme which is provably 
secure based solely on collision-free hashing. Our scheme enables a 
computationally bounded party to commit strings to an unbounded one, 
and  is optimal (within a small constant factor) in terms of interaction, 
communication, and computation. 
<p>

Our result also proves that constant round statistical zero-knowledge 
arguments and constant-round computational zero-knowledge proofs for 
NP exist based on the existence of collision-free hash functions.
