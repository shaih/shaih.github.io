<b> Abstract: </b> 
We present a new signature scheme which is existentially unforgeable 
under chosen message attacks, assuming some variant of the RSA conjecture. 
This scheme is not based on "signature trees", and instead it uses the 
so called "hash-and-sign" paradigm. It is unique in that the assumptions 
made on the cryptographic hash function in use are well defined and 
reasonable (although non-standard). 
In particular, we do not model this function as a random oracle. 
<P>

We construct our proof of security in steps.  First we describe and 
prove a construction which operates in the random oracle model. 
Then we show that the random oracle in this construction can be replaced 
by a hash function which satisfies some strong (but well defined!) 
computational assumptions. Finally, we demonstrate that these assumptions 
are reasonable, by proving that a function satisfying them exists under 
standard intractability assumptions.
