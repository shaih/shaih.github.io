<b> Abstract: </b> 
We present a convergence-function based clock synchronization
algorithm, which is simple, efficient and fault-tolerant. The
algorithm is tolerant of failures and allows recoveries, as long
as less than a third of the processors are faulty `at the same
time'. Arbitrary (Byzantine) faults are tolerated, without
requiring awareness of failure or recovery. In contrast, previous
clock synchronization algorithms limited the total number of
faults throughout the execution, which is not realistic, or
assumed fault detection.</P>

<P>The use of our algorithm ensures secure and reliable time
services, a requirement of many distributed systems and
algorithms. In particular, secure time is a fundamental
assumption of {\em proactive secure} mechanisms, which are also
designed to allow recovery from (arbitrary) faults. Therefore,
our work is crucial to realize these mechanisms securely.
