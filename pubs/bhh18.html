<b>Abstract: </b> 
Hyperledger Fabric is a "permissioned" blockchain architecture,
providing a consistent distributed ledger, shared by a set of "peers."
As with every blockchain architecture, the core principle of
Hyperledger Fabric is that all the peers must have the same view of
the shared ledger, making it challenging to support <i>private
data</i> for the different peers.  Extending Hyperledger Fabric to
support private data (that can influence transactions) would open the
door to many exciting new applications, in areas from healthcare to
commerce, insurance, finance, and more.</P>

<P>In this work we explored adding private-data support to Hyperledger
Fabric using secure multiparty computation (MPC). Specifically, in our
solution the peers store on the chain encryption of their private
data, and use secure MPC whenever such private data is needed in a
transaction. This solution is very general, allowing in principle to
base transactions on any combination of public and private data.</P>

<P>We created a demo of our solution over Hyperledger Fabric v1.0,
implementing a bidding system where sellers can list assets on the
ledger with a secret reserve price, and bidders publish their bids on
the ledger but keep secret the bidding price itself. We implemented a
smart contract (aka "chaincode") that runs the auction on this secret
data, using a simple secure-MPC protocol that was built using the
emp-toolkit library. The chaincode itself was written in Go, and we
used the SWIG library to make it possible to call our protocol
implementation in C++.</P>

<P>We identified two basic services that should be added to Hyperledger
Fabric to support our solution, and are now working on implementing
them.
