<h3><a name="Preface"></a>Preface</h3>
This page offers some tips on how to write a clear confernce submission. These
tips are just my own ideas about what I want to see in papers that I review.
For an excellent resource on how to write papers, go read Oded Goldreich's
essay at <a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/writing.html">
http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/writing.html</a>. 
<br/><br/>


My thesis is that to write clearly you must know what you want to say
and you must think about your readers; the rest will follow. For the
most part, this page contains many examples of these two principles.
These examples are geared toward authors of papers in theoretical
cryptography, but they are probably also relevant to other audiences.
<br/><br/>


<b>Two disclaimers:&nbsp;</b> First, I do not pretend to be an
authority on writing papers. You, the reader of this page, should only
take from the tips below whatever makes sense to you. Second, there is no
evidence that a clear submission has a better chance of being accepted
to a conference than a cluttered one. The mandate of a program
committee is to select for presentation the papers that describe the
most interesting advances in the area, not necessarily the best
written ones. But having clearly written submissions can make it
easier for the committee to do its job.

<h2>1 &nbsp; Things to keep in mind</h2>
<h3>1.1 &nbsp; Distill what you want to say</h3>

The most important thing in writing a paper is to decide what is it
that you want to say. The main point in writing a scientific paper is
to teach the reader something new. You need to make it crystal-clear
(to yourself, at least) exactly what this "something" is.
<br/><br/>


Try to summarize for yourself the main idea(s) in the paper as
concisely as you can. Can you summarize it in one sentence? In one
paragraph?  Imagine that your colleague (who is as fluent as you are
in your area of research) just came back from vacation, and you want
to tell her about your result in five minutes. You don't need to fill
her up on background, just the new idea. How would you describe it
then? Notice that the new idea can be anywhere from very specific to
very conceptual.  A few examples of such bare-bone summaries are listed
below (but don't take them too seriously).

<ul> 
<li type="circle">A specific obstacle in the security proof of the
Inactive-Pooch system of Theo Retician can be eliminated if instead of
trying to simulate all the threads you only simulate the "important
ones" (where a thread is important if it sets X=0).
<br/><br/></li>

<li type="circle">The notion of security for Attrition-schemes as defined
in Semi Nal's paper does not capture scenarios where the adversary can
mount man-in-the-middle attack <i>while standing on the sidelines</i>.
(You even have an attack on the provable-secure scheme from that paper
that works along this line.) You define a stronger notion that captures
the new aspect and show how it can be realized.
<br/><br/></li>

<li type="circle">The two seemingly unrelated concepts of L-functions
and R-attacks are actually equivalent if you just look at them from this
other direction. 
<br/><br/></li>

<li type="circle">You have a new method for Voluntary Sibling Separation
that is more efficient than previous work. You get the improvement by
plugging the new work of Al Gorithm instead of the usual negotiation
phase.
</li>
</ul>

<!-- ============================================================== -->
<h3>1.2 &nbsp; Think of the audience</h3>
Try to think who would you want to read your paper. For example, what
background does a reader need to have in order to understand and/or
appreciate the new result? If you find that one needs to know the
entire history of civilization just to understand your terminology, can
the presentation be altered so that the main ideas are understood without
so much prior knowledge?<br/><br/>

When writing the paper, make a conscious effort to see it through your
reader's eyes. You may have been thinking on the subject for weeks, know
exactly what goes where and have full knowledge of all the details. But
there is no reason to think that the reader has the same intimate
knowledge of all the relevant aspects. One way of simulating a reader
is to write the paper a long time in advance, put it out of sight for
a month or two, and then go back and read it. Unfortunately, this is
rarely applicable to a conference submission. If there are several
authors, it sometimes helps to read each other's parts.<br/><br/>

In the context of a conference submission, most readers only have a
few hours to read, understand, and evaluate your paper. They will need
all the help that you can give them. Make it a priority to give them as
much help as you can.

<!-- ============================================================== -->
<h2>2 &nbsp; The abstract and introduction</h2>

It is very helpful to the reader if you can put the one-sentence
summary of you idea already in the abstract. This may be hard to do,
especially if the new idea is very technical and specific, but when
possible it is well worth the effort. 
Consider the first example from above, regarding Retician's Inactive-Pooch
system. Although it is not possible to explain already in the abstract what
is the problem in the proof and why simulating only the important threads
helps, you may still be able to describe the main contribution of your
work as follows:

<blockquote><i>
Inactive-Pooch systems are very useful [...] However, they tend to be
quite inefficient. In particular, the famous scheme of Retician needs to
send O(k) bits for every tick. In this work we improve this to polylog(k)
bits per tick, by carefully modifying the proof of the main reduction in
Retician's work.
</i></blockquote>

Although the reader cannot understand at this point exactly what you
did, it is already clear that the contribution will not come by
introducing a whole new scheme, but rather by giving a better analysis
of the well known scheme of Retician. Moreover, a reader that makes it
to the technical part would know where to look for the main technical
contribution.<br/><br/>

Next comes the introduction. Here you have another chance to explain
what you do on a high level, and also why it is interesting. Keep in
mind the new thing that you want to teach your readers. By the end of
the introduction, the reader should know what is the new idea (even if
not all the details). <br/><br/>

It is sometimes possible to give all necessary
ideas in the introduction. The rest of the paper then just goes through
the motions of formalizing and proving everything, and most readers
could (in principle) do it themselves after reading the introduction.
Other times there are technical issues that are too involved to explain
in the introduction. Even in this case, however, the introduction should
give the reader some rough idea about what's coming next. Returning to
our running example of Inactive-Pooch systems, you may give a
high-level description of Retician's scheme, explaining that the
scheme sends a new key for every tick, and these keys are the most
communication-intensive components of the scheme. The reason that all
these keys are needed is that the simulator in the main reduction must
deal with each tick separately. However, you observe that there is no
need to simulate everything. Give a forward pointer to the technical
part, by saying that in the proof of Lemma 3 in Section 5 you show that
if the simulator only simulates the "important" threads, then it is
enough if the keys for the different ticks are t-wise independent
(rather than completely independent) therefore getting <i>polylog(k)</i>
bits per tick. <br/><br/>

Here are a few other things to keep in mind while writing the introduction:
<ul> 
<li>Go super easy on notations. Explain as much as possible with plain
English, and use notations only as a last resort. If you have in the
introduction something like 
<big>Adv</big><small><sub>A,B,T</sub><sup>CCA-PKT-RND5</sup></small>
(t,q,r), you should re-think your presentation.
<br/><br/></li>

<li>
Describe the relevant prior works, but skip the non-relevant ones.
(E.g., there is no reason to describe the entire history of research
into secure multi-party computation just because you describe an efficient
distributed protocol for computing the XOR function.)
<br/><br/></li>

<li>
Don't try to impress the reader with how complicated the problem is, or
how hard you had to work to solve it. Most readers are not interested
in how many versions of the definition or construction you went through
before arriving at the current one.
</li>
</ul>

<!-- ============================================================== -->
<h2>3 &nbsp; The technical parts</h2>
The thing to remember is to think of your readers while writing the
technical parts.  Below are a few specific considerations.
<ul>
<li>
Keep the reader informed about what's happening now and what's coming next.
Describe the overall structure of any construction/proof before diving
into the details. In every part, remind the reader what are the important
issues in this part, what are you trying to do, what part does the next
lemma plays in the big picture, etc. 
<br/><br/></li>

<li>Don't assume that the reader remembers (or even read) everything that
was written in the paper upto this point. If some aspect is important,
describe it more than once. (If it is very important, more than twice.)
Put many forward and backward pointers in the paper. ("in the next
section we show that...", "as discussed in Section 3, we need
to have...", etc.)
<br/><br/></li>

<li>Remember your target audience. Explain in detail those things that the
target audience is unfamiliar with (even if it is considered a basic
result in some other field), and only mention in passing things that
you believe are common knowledge.
<br/><br/></li>

<li>Go easy on notations. I find it easier to read "the advantage of an
adversary that runs for t time, makes q queries and gets r replies" than
<big>Adv</big><small><sub>A,B,T</sub><sup>CCA-PKT-RND5</sup></small>(t,q,r).
If you must use the latter, then at least sprinkle some English
explanations every so often. This holds in particular for super- and sub-scripting. Using 
notations such as <i>P<small><sup>b</sup><sub>i,j,k,r</sub></small></i> is a
sure way to lose your readers. (Especially if you have a typo and you
write <i>t</i> instead of <i>r</i> in one of the subscripts.)
Also, make sure that you explain every bit of notations. If you introduced
a piece of notations four pages ago and now came back to it, it would help
if you remind the reader what it means.
<br/><br/></li>

<li>Try to keep the presentation flowing without too much branching and
detours.  The attention span of your reader is not infinite, so don't
describe every little variation and every minute consideration to the
fourth order. (Otherwise the reader will never make it to the next
section, where you actually describe the crucial new observation that
is the heart of the paper.)
For the same reason, don't use too many footnotes. I personally prefer a
separate Discussion section at the end to having a slew of footnotes all
throughout the text. 
</li>
</ul>

<h2>4 &nbsp; Summing up</h2>
I've already said all that I had to say, so let me just repeat it. To
write clearly you must be clear about what you want to say, and you must
keep thinking about your readers while writing your paper.
