<b> Abstract: </b> 
We present a new proposal for a trapdoor one-way function, from which 
we derive public-key encryption and digital signatures. The security of 
the new construction is based on the conjectured computational difficulty 
of lattice-reduction problems, providing a possible alternative to 
existing public-key encryption algorithms and digital signatures such 
as RSA and DSS.
