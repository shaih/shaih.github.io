<b> Abstract: </b> 
We describe a construction of almost universal hash functions suitable
for very fast software implementation and applicable to the hashing of
variable size data and fast cryptographic message authentication.  Our
construction
uses fast single precision arithmetic which is increasingly supported
by modern processors due to the growing needs for fast arithmetic posed
by multimedia applications.

<p>
We report on hand-optimized assembly implementations on a 150 MHz PowerPC
604 and a 150 MHz Pentium-Pro, which achieve hashing speeds of 350 to 820
Mbit/sec, depending on the desired level of security (or collision
probability), and a rate of more than 1 Gbit/sec on a 200 MHz Pentium-Pro.
This represents a significant speed-up over current software implementations
of universal hashing and other message authentication techniques (e.g.,
MD5-based). Moreover, our construction is specifically designed to take
advantage of emerging microprocessor technologies (such as Intel's MMX,
64-bit architectures and others) and then best suited to accommodate the
growing performance needs of cryptographic (and other universal hashing)
applications.

<p>
The construction is based on techniques due to Carter and Wegman for
universal hashing using modular multilinear functions that we carefully
modify to allow for fast software implementation. We prove the resultant
construction to retain the necessary mathematical properties required for
its use in hashing and message authentication.
