<b> Abstract: </b> 
Storage Area Networks (SAN) are based on direct interaction
between clients and storage servers. This unmediated access
exposes the storage server to network attacks, necessitating a
verification, by the server, that the client requests conform with
the system protection policy. Solutions today can only enforce
access control at the granularity of entire storage servers. This
is an outcome of the way storage servers abstract storage: an
array of fixed size blocks. Providing access control at the
granularity of blocks is infeasible -- there are too many active
blocks in the server. Thus, the coarse granularity of entire
servers is used. Object stores (e.g., the NASD system) on the 
other hand provide means to address these issues. An object store 
control unit presents an abstraction of a dynamic collection of 
<i>objects</i>, each can be seen as a different array of blocks, 
thus providing the basis for protection at the object level.

In this paper we present a security model for the object store
which leverages on existing security infrastructure. We give a
simple generic mechanism capable of enforcing an arbitrary access
control policy at object granularity. This mechanism is
specifically designed to achieve low overhead by minimizing the
cost of validating an operation along the critical data path, and
lends itself for optimizations such as caching. The key idea of
the model is to separate the mechanisms for transport security
from the one used for access control and to maximize the use
standard security protocols when possible. We utilize a standard
industry protocol for authentication, integrity and privacy on the
communication channel (IPSec for IP networks) and define a
proprietary protocol for authorization on top of the secure
communication layer.
