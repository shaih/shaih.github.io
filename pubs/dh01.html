<b> Abstract: </b> 
We introduce the notion of <i>incremental</i> codes. Unlike a regular
code of a given rate, which is an unordered set of elements with a
large minimum distance, an incremental code is an ordered vector of
elements each of whose prefixes is a good regular code (of the
corresponding rate).  Additionally, while the quality of a regular
code is measured by its minimum distance, we measure the quality of an
incremental code <i>C</i> by its <i>competitive ratio</i>, <i>A</i>:
the minimum distance of each prefix of <i>C</i> has to be at most
a factor of <i>A</i> smaller than the minimum distance of the best
regular code of the same rate.</P>

We first consider incremental codes over an arbitrary compact metric
space <i>M</i>, and construct a 2-competitive code for <i>M</i>.  
When <i>M</i> is finite, the construction takes time <i>O(|M|^2)</i>, 
exhausts the entire space, and is NP-hard to improve in general. 
We then concentrate on two specific spaces: the real interval [0,1] 
and, most importantly, the Hamming space <i>F^n</i>. For the interval 
[0,1] we construct an optimal (infinite) code of competitive ratio 
<i>ln(4) ~ 1.386</i>. 
For the Hamming space <i>F^n</i> (where the generic 2-competitive
constructive is not efficient), we show the following. If <i>|F| >= n</i>,
we construct optimal (and efficient) 1-competitive code that exhausts
<i>F^n</i> (has rate 1). For small alphabets (<i>|F|</i> < <i>n</i>), 
we show that 1-competitive codes do not exist and provide several efficient
constructions of codes achieving constant competitive ratios. In
particular, our best construction has rate <i>(1-o(1))</i> and competitive
ratio <i>(2+o(1))</i>, essentially matching the bounds in the generic
construction.
