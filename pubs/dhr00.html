<b> Abstract: </b> 
In this work we use cryptography to solve a game-theoretic problem
which arises naturally in the area of two party strategic games.
The standard game-theoretic solution concept for such games is that of
an <i>equilibrium</i>, which is a pair of "self-enforcing" strategies
making each player's strategy an optimal response to the other player's 
strategy. It is known that for many games the expected equilibrium 
payoffs can be much higher when a trusted third party (a "mediator") 
assists the players in choosing their moves (correlated equilibria), 
than when each player has to choose its move on its own (Nash equilibria). 
It is natural to ask whether there exists a mechanism that eliminates the 
need for the mediator yet allows the players to maintain the high payoffs 
offered by mediator-assisted strategies.  
We answer this question affirmatively provided the players are
computationally bounded and can have free communication (so-called
"cheap talk") prior to playing the game.</P>

The main building block of our solution is an efficient cryptographic
protocol to the following <i>Correlated element selection</i> problem, 
which is of independent interest. Both Alice and Bob know a list of pairs 
<i>(a1,b1)...(an,bn)</i> (possibly with repetitions), and they want to 
pick a random index <i>i</i> such that Alice learns only <i>ai</i> and
Bob learns only <i>bi</i>. Our solution to this problem has constant
number of rounds, negligible error probability, and uses only very
simple zero-knowledge proofs.  We then show how to incorporate our 
cryptographic protocol back into a game-theoretic setting, which 
highlights some interesting parallels between cryptographic protocols 
and extensive form games.
