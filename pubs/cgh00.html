<b> Abstract: </b> 
We discuss the following problem: Given an integer <i>phi</i>, shared 
secretly among <i>n</i> players and a prime number <i>e</i>, how can 
the players efficiently compute a sharing of <i>e^{-1} mod phi</i>. 
The most interesting case is when <i>phi</i> is the Euler function of 
a known RSA modulus <i>N</i>, <i>phi = phi(N)</i>.  The problem has 
several applications, among which the construction of threshold variants 
for two recent signature schemes proposed by Gennaro-Halevi-Rabin and 
Cramer-Shoup.</P>
<P>
We present new and efficient protocols to solve this problem, improving 
over previous solutions by Boneh-Franklin and Frankel et al. Our basic 
protocol (secure against honest but curious players) requires only two 
rounds of communication and a single GCD computation.  The robust protocol 
(secure against malicious players) adds only a couple of rounds and a few 
modular exponentiations to the computation.
