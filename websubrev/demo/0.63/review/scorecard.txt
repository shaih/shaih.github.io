Some caveats:
-------------
This software is currently a PHP/MySQL software, which means that to
use it you must have a MySQL server and a PHP engine (and your web-server
must supports PHP and MySQL). I tested the software with PHP 4.3.2 and
MySQL 3.23 (both quite old now), as well as PHP 5.0.4 and MySQL 4.1.12.
It may work with even older versions (but it may not). Also, the proper 
functioning of this software depend on "proper" functioning of you
web-server.
In particular, two issues that I came across are:

* The scripts must be able to write and create sub-directories in the
  BASE directory. When using this software on on Linux with an Apache
  server (running as user "apache"), I had to chdir to the BASE directory
  and make sure the directory and all the files in it are owned by user
  "apache".

* The web-server (and the PHP engine) must be willing to upload files.
  For example, in one system that I used to test it, the PHP engine was
  configured to only allow uploads of files upto 500KB (and I was
wrecking
  my brains as to why I can only upload pdf and not postscript files..)
In
  my case it turned out that I had to change the parameter
LimitRequestBody
  in php.conf (which on that system was somewhere under /etc/httpd/).

Bush Commutes Libby’s Prison Sentence
Doug Mills/The New York Times

WASHINGTON, July 2 — President Bush said today that he had used his power
of clemency to commute the 30-month sentence for I. Lewis Libby Jr., the
former top aide to Vice President Dick Cheney, who was convicted of
perjury in March and was due to begin serving his time within weeks.

The action, announced just hours after a federal appeals court denied Mr.
Libby’s request to allow him to remain free while his case is on appeal,
spares Mr. Libby his prison term, but it does not excuse him from stiff
fines or probation.

In a statement issued early this evening announcing his decision, Mr. Bush
said he had listened to both critics and defenders of Mr. Libby, who was
convicted of four felony counts for lying during a C.I.A. leak
investigation.

“I respect the jury’s verdict,” Mr. Bush said. “But I have concluded that
the prison sentence given to Mr. Libby is excessive. Therefore, I am
commuting the portion of Mr. Libby’s sentence that required him to spend
30 months in prison.”

# Different reviews in the same file are separated with a line of '+'
# symbols (at least 20 '+' symbols, with no white-spaces or anything
# else). 
# 
# Each review starts by a line containing the submission number and
# optionally the title. The software ignores the title and only uses
# the submission number to identify the submission that you are
# reviewing. (It will, however, display a warning if you supply a
# title that is "too far from the right one"). You can optionally put
# the authors names in the next line, the software will ignore this.
# 
# Next you can put the name of a sub-reviewer. If this line is
# missing or the name left empty, the software will record no
# sub-reviewer for this review. 
# 
# Next comes lines for the score and confidence. If the num is not
# supplied, the software will record the special symbol 'ignore'.
# Next you can put lines for the other evaluation criteria that the
# chair specified (e.g., Technical, Editorial quality, etc). If the
# software does not recognize a criterion it will ignore that line
# and display a warning. 
#
# Next comes the comments. Anything after the tag "AUTHOR-COMMENTS:"
# (which must be at the beginning of a line) and on the following
# lines is considered comments-to-authors, until the end of the
# review or until a line that begins with "PC-COMMENTS:" or
# "CHAIR-COMMENTS:". Similarly, these two tags denote the beginning
# of the comments-to-committee or comments-to-chair, respectively.
