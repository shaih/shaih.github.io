<DIV class=fixed>Some caveats:<BR>-------------<BR>This software is currently a 
PHP/MySQL software, which means that to<BR>use it you must have a MySQL server 
and a PHP engine (and your web-server<BR>must supports PHP and MySQL). I tested 
the software with PHP 4.3.2 and<BR>MySQL 3.23 (both quite old now), as well as 
PHP 5.0.4 and MySQL 4.1.12.<BR>It may work with even older versions (but it may 
not). Also, the proper <BR>functioning of this software depend on "proper" 
functioning of you web-server.<BR>In particular, two issues that I came across 
are:<BR><BR>* The scripts must be able to write and create sub-directories in 
the<BR>BASE directory. When using this software on on Linux with an 
Apache<BR>server (running as user "apache"), I had to chdir to the BASE 
directory<BR>and make sure the directory and all the files in it are owned by 
user<BR>"apache".<BR><BR>* The web-server (and the PHP engine) must be willing 
to upload files.<BR>For example, in one system that I used to test it, the PHP 
engine was<BR>configured to only allow uploads of files upto 500KB (and I was 
wrecking<BR>my brains as to why I can only upload pdf and not postscript 
files..) In<BR>my case it turned out that I had to change the parameter 
LimitRequestBody<BR>in php.conf (which on that system was somewhere under 
/etc/httpd/).<BR><BR><A href="../subs/1.txt">TXT attachment</A>
