Comments to Authors:
Napoleon Crossing the Alps (also known as Napoleon at the Saint-Bernard
Pass or Bonaparte Crossing the Alps) is the title given to the five
versions of an oil on canvas equestrian portrait of Napoleon Bonaparte
painted by the French artist Jacques-Louis David between 1801 and 1805.
Initially commissioned by the Spanish Ambassador to France, the
composition shows a strongly idealized view of the real crossing that
Napoleon and his army made across the Alps in 1800.

Some caveats:
-------------
This software is currently a PHP/MySQL software, which means that to
use it you must have a MySQL server and a PHP engine (and your web-server
must supports PHP and MySQL). I tested the software with PHP 4.3.2 and
MySQL 3.23 (both quite old now), as well as PHP 5.0.4 and MySQL 4.1.12.
It may work with even older versions (but it may not). Also, the proper 
functioning of this software depend on &quot;proper&quot; functioning of you
web-server.
In particular, two issues that I came across are:

* The scripts must be able to write and create sub-directories in the
  BASE directory. When using this software on on Linux with an Apache
  server (running as user &quot;apache&quot;), I had to chdir to the BASE directory
  and make sure the directory and all the files in it are owned by user
  &quot;apache&quot;.

* The web-server (and the PHP engine) must be willing to upload files.
  For example, in one system that I used to test it, the PHP engine was
  configured to only allow uploads of files upto 500KB (and I was wrecking
  my brains as to why I can only upload pdf and not postscript files..) In
  my case it turned out that I had to change the parameter LimitRequestBody
  in php.conf (which on that system was somewhere under /etc/httpd/).

Comments to Authors:
In this paper, we present an efficient signature scheme without random
oracles using Waters private key construction. Our scheme has shorter
public parameter size when compared to Kenny and Schuldt signature, the
signature space of our basic scheme consists of three group elements, we
further show that the signature space can be reduced to two group
elements. The security of our signature scheme is proved in the standard
model under adaptive identity security notion.

Bush Commutes Libby’s Prison Sentence
Doug Mills/The New York Times

WASHINGTON, July 2 — President Bush said today that he had used his power
of clemency to commute the 30-month sentence for I. Lewis Libby Jr., the
former top aide to Vice President Dick Cheney, who was convicted of
perjury in March and was due to begin serving his time within weeks.

The action, announced just hours after a federal appeals court denied Mr.
Libby’s request to allow him to remain free while his case is on appeal,
spares Mr. Libby his prison term, but it does not excuse him from stiff
fines or probation.

In a statement issued early this evening announcing his decision, Mr. Bush
said he had listened to both critics and defenders of Mr. Libby, who was
convicted of four felony counts for lying during a C.I.A. leak
investigation.

“I respect the jury’s verdict,” Mr. Bush said. “But I have concluded that
the prison sentence given to Mr. Libby is excessive. Therefore, I am
commuting the portion of Mr. Libby’s sentence that required him to spend
30 months in prison.”

Judge affirms ruling to dismiss Gitmo charges

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A military judge on Friday rejected the Pentagon's
request to reinstate previously dismissed charges against a prisoner
accused of killing a U.S. soldier in Afghanistan in 2001, officials said.

A guard checks on a detainee at the U.S. naval station at Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba, in April.

Judge Army Col. Peter Brownback dropped the charges against Canadian
detainee Omar Khadr last month on the grounds Brownback's court lacked the
jurisdiction to try him.

Khadr was 15 when he was arrested.

The inability to prosecute centered on Khadr not being labeled an
&quot;unlawful&quot; enemy combatant.

Last June, Brownback said new congressional rules on trying detainees
specify that a detainee must be designated an &quot;unlawful enemy combatant.&quot;

Pentagon officials would not release Brownback's most recent decision, but
said he ruled the prosecution had presented no new evidence or arguments to
change his mind.

The prosecution has five days to appeal to the Court of Military
Commissions Review in Washington.

Comments to Authors:
Pairing based cryptography is a new public key cryptographic scheme. An
elliptic curve suitable for pairing based cryptography is called a
``pairing-friendly'' elliptic curve. After Mitsunari, Sakai and Kasahara's
traitor tracing scheme and Boneh and Boyen's short signature scheme, many
protocols based on pairing-related problems such as the $q$-weak
Diffie-Hellman problem have been proposed. In Eurocrypt 2006, Cheon
proposed a new efficient algorithm to solve pairing-related problems and
recently the complexity of Cheon's algorithm has been improved by Kozaki,
Kutsuma and Matsuo. Due to these two works, an influence of Cheon's
algorithm should be considered when we construct a suitable curves for the
use of a protocol based on a pairing-related problem. Among known methods
for constructing pairing-friendly elliptic curves, ones using cyclotomic
polynomials such as the Brezing-Weng method and the Freeman-Scott-Teske
method are affected by Cheon's algorithm. In this paper, we study how to
reduce a security loss of a cyclotomic family by Cheon's algorithm. The
proposed method constructs many pairing-friendly elliptic curves with
small security loss by Cheon's algorithm suitable for protocols based on
pairing-related problems.

Comments to Authors:
Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the volume and
quality of traffic to a web site from search engines via &quot;natural&quot; search
results. Usually, the earlier a site is presented in the search results,
or the higher it &quot;ranks,&quot; the more searchers will visit that site. SEO can
also target different kinds of search, including image search, local
search, and industry-specific vertical search engines. As a marketing
strategy for increasing a site's relevancy, SEO considers how search
algorithms work and what people search for. SEO efforts may involve a
site's coding, presentation, and structure, as well as fixing problems
that could prevent search engine indexing programs from fully spidering a
site. Other, more noticeable efforts may include adding unique content to
a site, and making sure that the content is easily indexed by search
engines and also appeals to human visitors. The acronym &quot;SEO&quot; can also
refer to &quot;search engine optimizers,&quot; a term adopted by an industry of
consultants who carry out optimization projects on behalf of clients, and
by employees who perform SEO services in-house.
