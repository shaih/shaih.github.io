<h1>Uploading Preface/TOC/Author-index to the server</h1>
Use this form to upload to the server an archive file with the
preface, TOC, author-index, etc. You can use this option to have on the
server a complete mirror of the publication material that was sent to
the publisher (e.g., for archiving purposes).

The preface file should be prepared using the same conventions as
the other camera-ready files (possibly by strating from the template
that was generated with <a href="makeTOC.html">this form</a>). Prepare
an archive file (zip/tar/tgz) that includes all the source files that
were used to generate the peface, TOC, author-index, and anything else
that you want to upload, and then upload this one archive file to the
server using the form below.<br/>
