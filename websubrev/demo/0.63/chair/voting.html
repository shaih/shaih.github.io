<h1>Setup/Manage Voting</h1>
<h2>Vote Parameters: Invited Speakers</h2>
There are two types of votes that you can set-up:
<ul>
<li>One is simple "Choose vote"
in which you specify a list of submissions and every PC member needs to
choose some number of them. For example, "Choose up to three of the
submissions in 'Maybe Reject' category to move back to the 'Discuss' pile."
<br><br></li>
<li>The other type is a "Grade vote" in which you specify a list of submissions
and every PC member needs to grade these submissions on some scale. For
example, "Grade each of the remaining submissions in the 'Discuss' category
on a scale of zero to three."
<small>(Technically, a "Choose vote" is a special case of a "Grade vote"
with the scale being 0-1, but the interface that the PC member sees for
a "Choose vote" is slightly simpler than for a "Grade vote".)</small>
</li>
</ul>
In either type of vote, the tally is the sum of votes that each submission
received. (In the "Choose vote" this is the number of PC members that chose
that submission.)<br>
<br>
<form action="voting1.html" enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post" ID="votePrms">
<b>Title:</b>&nbsp; <input name="voteTitle" size="60" value="Invited Speakers" type="text"> (used to distinguish this ballot from others)<br>
<b>Deadline:</b> <input name="voteDeadline" size="56" value="July 20, 2007" type="text"> (displayed on the voting page)<br>
<br>
<b>Instructions for PC members</b> (displayed on the voting page):<br>
<textarea name="voteInstructions" rows="7" cols="80">Choose two of the following candidates for invited speakers</textarea>

<h3>Vote type</h3>
<input name="voteType" value="Choose" checked="checked" type="radio">
A simple "Choose vote"<br>
<input name="voteType" value="Grade" type="radio">
A "Grade vote" on a scale of 0 to
<input name="voteMaxGrade" size="1" value="1" type="text" onkeyup="return gradeChk(this);">
(max-grade cannot be more than 9).<br>
<br>
Every PC member has "voting budget" of 
<input name="voteBudget" size="1" value="2" type="text"> (empty or zero
for unlimited budget). For a "Choose vote", the budget is the number of
submissions that the PC member can choose. For a "Grade vote", it
is the sum of all grades that this PC member can assign.

<h3>What is included in this vote?</h3>
<b>Note:</b> PC members can only vote on submissions after you set their
"discuss" flags from the <a href="overview.html#progress">progress overview
page</a>. Until then they can only participate in "votes on other things"
as per the third option below.<br>
<br>
<input name="voteOnWhat" value="all" type="radio">
Include all submissions.
<br>
<input name="voteOnWhat" value="some" type="radio">
Include only the submissions that are specified below
(<a href="../documentation/chair.html#votes" target="_blank">more info</a>):
<br>
<table><tbody>
<tr><td></td>
    <td style="text-align: right;">&nbsp; &nbsp;submissions in the:</td>
    <td><input name="voteOnAC" type="checkbox"  onchange="return voteOnChk(this,1);">'Accept' category,</td>

<tr><td> &nbsp; &nbsp; </td>
    <td style="text-align: right;">..and also these submission IDs:</td>
    <td colspan="2"><input name="voteOnThese" value="" size="80" type="text" onkeyup="return voteOnChk(this,1);"><br>comma-separated list of submission-IDs</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<br>
<input name="voteOnWhat" value="other" checked="checked" type="radio">
Vote on things other than submissions (e.g., invited speaker):
<textarea name="voteItems" rows="5" cols="80" onkeyup="return voteOnChk(this,2);">Franz Beckenbauer; Johan Cruijff; Diego Maradona; Pele; Zinedine Zidane</textarea><br>
A <b>semi-colon separated</b> list of items to vote on. For example, to let
the PC members choose their main course for the PC dinner, you can use a line
such as <tt>"Maine Lobster; Australian barramundi; Squab breast; Medallions of
Millbrook venison; Lamb rack 'au sautoir'"</tt>.<br>
<br><b>Note:</b>
If you modify the list of submission-IDs or the list of "other things" in
mid-vote, make sure that you <i>do not modify the order of items</i>, since
the software identifies vote-items with their position in the list. 
For example, swapping the order of two items will result in each of them
being assigned the tally of the other. <br>
