<div class="indented"><b>Abstract:</b>
    <br /><span class="fixed">The notion of key privacy for encryption schemes was defined formally by Bellare, Boldyreva, Desai and Pointcheval in Asiacrypt 2001. This notion seems useful in settings where anonymity is important. In this short note we describe a (very simple) sufficient condition for key privacy. In a nutshell, a scheme that provides data privacy is guaranteed to provide also key privacy if the distribution of a *random encryption of a random message* is independent of the public key that is used for the encryption.</span>

<div class="indented"><b>Abstract:</b>
    <br /><span class="fixed">We describe two new public key broadcast encryption systems for<br />
stateless receivers.  Both systems are fully secure against any number<br />
of colluders. In our first construction both ciphertexts and private<br />
keys are of constant size (only two group elements), for any<br />
subset of receivers.  The public key size in this system is<br />
linear in the total number of receivers.  Our second system is a<br />
generalization of the first that provides a tradeoff between<br />
ciphertext size and public key size.  For example, we achieve a<br />
collusion resistant broadcast system for n users where both<br />
ciphertexts and public keys are of size O(sqrt(n)) for any subset<br />
of receivers.  We discuss several applications of these systems.<br />

<div class="indented"><b>Category/Keywords:</b> public-key cryptography / hybrid encryption
</div>
<div class="indented"><b>Abstract:</b>
    <br /><span class="fixed">This paper presents a novel framework for generic construction of hybrid encryption schemes which produces more efficient schemes than before.  A known framework introduced by Shoup combines a key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) and a data encryption mechanism (DEM). While it is believed that both of the components must be secure against chosen ciphertext attacks, Kurosawa and Desmedt showed a particular example of KEM that might not be CCA but can be securely combined with CCA DEM yielding more efficient hybrid encryption scheme.  There are also many efficient hybrid encryption schemes in various settings that do not fit to the framework.  These facts serve as motivation to seek another framework that yields more efficient schemes.<br />
<br />
In addition to the potential efficiency of the resulting schemes, our<br />
framework will provide insightful explanation about existing schemes<br />
that do not fit to the previous framework.  This could result in finding improvements for some schemes.  Moreover, it allows immediate conversion from a class of threshold public-key encryption to a hybrid one without considerable overhead, which is not possible in the previous approach.<br />

<div class="indented"><b>Abstract:</b>
    <br /><span class="fixed">In 1998, Blaze, Bleumer, and Strauss (BBS) proposed an application called<br />
atomic proxy re-encryption, in which a semi-trusted proxy<br />
converts a ciphertext for Alice into a ciphertext for Bob without <br />
seeing the underlying plaintext.  We predict that fast and<br />
secure re-encryption will become increasingly popular as a method for<br />
managing encrypted file systems.  Although efficiently computable, the<br />
wide-spread adoption of BBS re-encryption has been hindered by<br />
considerable security risks.  Following recent work of Ivan and Dodis,<br />
we present new re-encryption schemes that realize a stronger notion of<br />
security and we demonstrate the usefulness of proxy re-encryption as a<br />
method of adding access control to the SFS read-only file system.<br />
Performance measurements of our experimental file system demonstrate<br />
that proxy re-encryption can work effectively in practice.</span>

<div class="indented"><b>Abstract:</b>
    <br /><span class="fixed">We present a formal model and a simple architecture for robust pseudorandom generation that ensures resilience in the face of an<br />
observer with partial knowledge/control of the generator's entropy source. Our model and architecture have the following properties:<br />
<br />
<br />
1 Resilience:  The generator's output looks random to an observer with no knowledge of the internal state. This holds even if that observer has complete control over data that is used to refresh the internal state.<br />
<br />
2 Forward security: Past output of the generator looks random to an observer, even if the observer learns the internal state at a later time.<br />
<br />
3 Backward security/Break-in recovery: Future output of the generator looks random, even to an observer with knowledge of the current state, provided that the generator is refreshed with data of sufficient entropy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Architectures such as above were suggested before. This work differs<br />
from previous attempts in that we present a formal model for robust<br />
pseudo-random generation, and provide a formal proof within this model<br />
for the security of our architecture. To our knowledge, this is the<br />
first attempt at a rigorous model for this problem.<br />
<br />
Our formal modeling advocates the separation of the *entropy extraction* phase from the *output generation* phase. We argue that the former is information-theoretic in nature, and could therefore rely on combinatorial and statistical tools rather than on cryptography. On the other hand, we show that the latter can be implemented using any standard (non-robust) cryptographic PRG.<br />
<br />
We also discuss the applicability of our architecture for applications such as /dev/(u)random in Linux and pseudorandom generation on smartcards.<br />

    <br /><span class="fixed">This paper develops a cryptanalysis of the pairing based Diffie<br />
Hellman (DH) key exchange schemes an instance of which is the<br />
triparty single round key exchange proposed in cite{joux}. The<br />
analysis of emph{weak sessions} of the standard DH scheme<br />
proposed in cite{kasu} is applied to show existence of weak<br />
sessions for such schemes over supersingular curves. It is shown<br />
that for such sessions the associated Bilinear Diffie Hellman<br />
Problem is solvable in polynomial time, without computing the<br />
private keys i.e. without solving the discrete logarithms. Other<br />
applications of the analysis to Decisional Diffie Hellman Problem<br />
and the identitiy based DH scheme are also shown to hold. The<br />
triparty key exchange scheme is analyzed for illustration and it<br />
is shown that the number of weak keys increases in this scheme as<br />
compared to the standard two party DH scheme. It is shown that the<br />
random choice of private keys by the users independent of each<br />
other's knowledge is insecure in these schemes. Algorithms are<br />
suggested for checking weakness of private keys based on an order<br />
of selection.</span>

    <br /><span class="fixed">The group of m-torsion points on an elliptic curve, for a prime<br />
number m, forms a two-dimensional vector space. It was suggested<br />
and proven by Yoshida that under certain conditions the vector<br />
decomposition problem (VDP) on a two-dimensional vector space is<br />
at least as hard as the computational Diffie-Hellman problem<br />
(CDHP) on a one-dimensional subspace. In this work we show that<br />
even though this assessment is true, it applies to the VDP for<br />
m-torsion points on an elliptic curve only if the curve is<br />
supersingular. But in that case the CDHP on the one-dimensional<br />
subspace has a known sub-exponential solution. Furthermore, we<br />
present a family of hyperelliptic curves of genus two that are<br />
suitable for the VDP.</span>

<div class="indented"><b>Abstract:</b>
    <br /><span class="fixed">Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems aim to identify objects in open environments with neither physical nor visual contact. They consist of transponders inserted into objects, of readers, and usually of a database which contains information about the objects. The key point is that authorised readers must be able to identify tags without an adversary being able to trace them. Traceability is often underestimated by advocates of the technology and sometimes exaggerated by its detractors. Whatever the true picture, this problem is a reality when it blocks the deployment of this technology and some companies, faced with being boycotted, have already abandoned its use. Using cryptographic primitives to thwart the traceability issues is an approach which has been explored for several years. However, the research carried out up to now has not provided satisfactory results as no universal formalism has been defined. <br />
In this paper, we propose an adversarial model suitable for RFID environments. We define the notions of existential and universal untraceability and we model the access to the communication channels from a set of oracles. We show that our formalisation fits the problem being considered and allows a formal analysis of the protocols in terms of traceability. We use our model on several well-known RFID protocols and we show that most of them have weaknesses and are vulnerable to traceability.</span>
