<h3>Acceptance letters</h3>
<textarea name="accLetter" cols=80 rows=13>Dear &lt;$authors&gt;,

It is our pleasure to inform you that your submission

  &quot;&lt;$title&gt;&quot;

was accepted to TEST 2007. Congratulations.

Please confirm receipt of this email, and provide us with the
(corrected) title and complete list of authors and affiliations.
This will allow us to distribute the list of accepted papers.

The selection of the papers was a challenging and difficult task. The
Program Committee members have put in a significant effort in order to
provide useful feedback to the authors, but due to time constraints, this
was not always possible.

In a few days, we will forward the comments on your paper and the
instructions for producing and sending the final version. You will
need your submission-ID and password in order to upload the camera-ready
version. These are:

Submission-ID: &lt;$subId&gt;
Password:      &lt;$subPwd&gt;

In order to be included in the proceedings, the final version of your paper
must be received no later than Thu, 15 Nov 2007 23:00:00 +0000 (UTC).
This is a firm deadline.

Thank you very much for contributing to TEST 2007.
We are looking forward to seeing you at the conference.

Sincerely,

TEST 2007 program chair(s)</textarea>

<h3>Rejection letters</h3>
<textarea name="rejLetter" cols=80 rows=13>Dear &lt;$authors&gt;,

We are sorry to inform you that your submission

  &quot;&lt;$title&gt;&quot;

was not accepted to TEST 2007.

We received many good submissions, but could only accept a small number
of them to the program.

The selection of the papers was a challenging and difficult task. The
Program Committee members have put in a significant effort in order to
provide useful feedback to the authors, but due to time constraints, this
was not always possible. We will send you the comments on your paper in a
few days. 

Thank you very much for submitting your work to TEST 2007,
and we hope to see you at the conference.

Sincerely,
