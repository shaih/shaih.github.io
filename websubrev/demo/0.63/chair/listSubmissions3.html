</div>
<div class="indented"><b>Abstract:</b>
    <br><span class="fixed">Key derivation refers to the process by which an agreed upon large<br>
random number, often named master secret, is used to derive keys to<br>
encrypt and authenticate data. Practitioners and standardization <br>
bodies have usually used the random oracle model to get key material<br>
from a Diffie-Hellman key exchange. However, proofs in the standard model <br>
require randomness extractors to formally extract the entropy of the <br>
random master secret into a seed prior to derive other keys.<br>
<br>
This paper first deals with the protocol $Sigma_0$, in which the key<br>
derivation phase is (deliberately) omitted, and security inaccuracies<br>
in the analysis and design of the Internet Key Exchange <br>
(IKE version 1) protocol, corrected in IKEv2. <br>
They do not endanger the practical use of IKEv1, since the security<br>
could be proved, at least, in the random oracle model. <br>
However, in the standard model, there is not yet any formal global security <br>
proof, but just separated analyses which do not fit together well.<br>
The first simplification is common in the theoretical security analysis<br>
of several key exchange protocols, whereas the key derivation phase is a <br>
crucial step for theoretical reasons, but also practical purpose, and<br>
requires careful analysis. The second problem is a gap between the<br>
recent theoretical analysis of HMAC as a good randomness extractor<br>
(functions keyed with public but random elements) and its practical<br>
use in IKEv1 (the key may not be totally random, because of the lack<br>
of clear authentication of the nonces). <br>
Since the latter problem comes from the probabilistic property of this <br>
extractor, we thereafter review some 	extit{deterministic} <br>
randomness extractors and suggest the emph{Twist-AUgmented} <br>
technique, a new extraction method quite well-suited for<br>
Diffie-Hellman-like scenarios.</span>

<div class="indented"><b>Category/Keywords:</b> foundations / obfuscation, point functions
</div>
<div class="indented"><b>Abstract:</b>
    <br><span class="fixed">We study the problem of obfuscation in the context of point functions <br>
(also known as delta functions). A point function is a Boolean<br>
function that assumes the value 1 at exactly one point. Our main<br>
results are as follows:<br>
<br>
- We provide a simple construction of efficient obfuscators for<br>
point functions for a slightly relaxed notion of obfuscation - wherein<br>
the size of the simulator has an inverse polynomial dependency on the<br>
distinguishing probability - which is nonetheless impossible for<br>
general circuits. This is the first known construction of obfuscators<br>
for a non-trivial family of functions under general computational<br>
assumptions. Our obfuscator is based on a probabilistic hash function<br>
constructed from a very strong one-way permutation, and does<br>
not require any set-up assumptions. Our construction also yields<br>
an obfuscator for point functions with multi-bit output.<br>
<br>
- We show that such a strong one-way permutation - wherein any<br>
polynomial-sized circuit inverts the permutation on at most a<br>
polynomial number of inputs - can be realized using a random<br>
permutation oracle. We prove the result by improving on the counting<br>
argument used in [GT00], this result may be of independent<br>
interest. It follows that our construction yields obfuscators for<br>
point functions in the non-programmable random permutation oracle<br>
model (in the sense of [N02]). Furthermore, we prove that an<br>
assumption like the one we used is necessary for our obfuscator<br>
construction.<br>
<br>
- Finally, we establish two impossibility results on obfuscating<br>
point functions which indicate that the limitations on our<br>
construction (in simulating only adversaries with single-bit output<br>
and in using non-uniform advice in our simulator) are in some sense<br>
inherent. The first of the two results is a consequence of a simple<br>
characterization of functions that can be obfuscated against general<br>
adversaries with multi-bit output as the class of functions that are<br>
efficiently and exactly learnable using membership queries.<br>
<br>
We stress that prior to this work, what is known about obfuscation are<br>
negative results for the general class of circuits [BGI01] and<br>
positive results in the random oracle model [LPS04] or under<br>
non-standard number-theoretic assumptions [C97]. This work<br>
represents the first effort to bridge the gap between the two for a<br>
natural class of functionalities.</span>

the complexity 2^66 and 256-bit key with the complexity 2^67. In the
case of B mode with 256-bit key, we show a known-plaintext attack
recovering the whole plaintext with the complexity 2^140. All attacks
need only a small part of the plaintext to be known.</span>

<div class="indented"><b>Abstract:</b>
    <br><span class="fixed">In~cite{AV96}, W. Aiello and R. Venkatesan have shown how to<br>
construct pseudo-random functions of $2n$ bits $<br>
ightarrow 2n$<br>
bits from pseudo-random functions of $n$ bits $<br>
ightarrow n$<br>
bits. They claimed that their construction, called "Benes",<br>
reaches the optimal bound ($mll 2^n$) of security against<br>
adversaries with unlimited computing power but limited by $m$<br>
queries in an adaptive chosen plaintext attack (CPA-2). However a<br>
complete proof of this result is not given in~cite{AV96} since<br>
one of the assertions of~cite{AV96} is wrong. Due to this, the<br>
proof given in~cite{AV96} is valid for most attacks, but not for<br>
all the possible chosen plaintext attacks. In this paper we will<br>
in a way fix this problem since for all $varepsilon&gt;0$, we will<br>
prove CPA-2 security when $mll 2^{n(1-varepsilon)}$. However we<br>
will also see that the probability to distinguish Benes functions<br>
from random functions is sometime larger than the term in<br>
$frac{m^2}{2^{2n}}$ given in~cite{AV96}. One of the key idea in<br>
our proof will be to notice that, when $mgg2^{2n/3}$ and<br>
$mll2^n$, for large number of variables linked with some critical<br>
equalities, the average number of solutions may be large (i.e.<br>
$gg1$) while, at the same time, the probability to have at least<br>
one such critical equalities is negligible (i.e. $ll1$).</span>

remains the same and thus the same keystream generated from RC4 is

<div class="indented"><b>Abstract:</b>
    <br><span class="fixed">Hash
chains are widely used in various cryptographic systems such as
electronic micropayments and one-time passwords etc. However, hash
chains suffer from the limitation that they have a finite number of
links which when used up requires the system to re-initialize new hash
chains. So system design has to reduce the overhead when hash chains
are re-initialized. Recently, Vipul Goyal proposed an elegant
one-time-signature-based method to re-initialize hash chains, in this
efficient method an infinite number of finite length hash chains can be
tied together so that hash chains can be securely re-initialized in a
non-repudiable manner. Vipul Goyal¡¯s method is improved in this
paper to reach a little more efficient method, which, more importantly,
is a natural extension of the concept of conventional hash chains.</span>

<div class="indented"><b>Abstract:</b>
    <br><span class="fixed">T-functions
were introduced by Klimov and Shamir in a series of papers during the
last few years. They are of great interest for cryptography as they may
provide some new building blocks which can be used to construct
efficient and secure schemes, for example block ciphers, stream ciphers
or hash functions.<br>
In the present paper, we define the narrowness of a T-function and
study how this property affects the strength of a T-function as a
cryptographic primitive.<br>
We define a new data strucure, called a solution graph, that enables
solving systems of equations given by T-functions. The efficiency of
the algorithms which we propose for solution graphs depends
significantly on the narrowness of the involved T-functions.<br>
Thus the subclass of T-functions with small narrowness appears to be weak and should be avoided in cryptographic schemes.<br>
Furthermore, we present some extensions to the methods of using
solution graphs, which make it possible to apply these algorithms also
to more general systems of equations, which may appear, for example, in
the cryptanalysis of hash functions.<br>

    <br><span class="fixed">We
prove that security in the Universal Composability framework (UC) is
equivalent to security in the probabilistic polynomial time calculus
ppc. Security is defined under active and adaptive adversaries with
synchronous and authenticated communication. In detail, we define an
encoding from machines in UC to processes in ppc and show it is fully
abstract with respect to UC-security and ppc-security, i.e., we show a
protocol is UC-secure iff its encoding is ppc-secure. However, we
restrict security in ppc to be quantified not over all possible
contexts, but over those induced by UC-environments under encoding.
This result is not overly-simplifying security in ppc, since the threat
and communication models we assume are meaningful in both practice and
theory.</span>

    <br><span class="fixed">The
main result of this paper is that the Dolev-Yao model is a safe
abstraction of the computational model for security protocols including
those that combine asymmetric and symmetric encryption, signature and
hashing. Moreover, message forwarding and private key transmission are
allowed. To our knowledge this is the first result that deals with hash
functions and the combination of these cryptographic primitives. <br>
<br>
A key step towards this result is a general definition of correction of
cryptographic primitives, that unifies well known correctness criteria
such as IND-CPA, IND-CCA, unforgeability etc.... and a theorem that
allows to reduce the correctness of a composition of two cryptographic
schemes to the correctness of each one.</span>

<div class="indented"><b>Abstract:</b>
    <br><span class="fixed">Recently new types of differential power analysis attacks (DPA)<br>
against elliptic curve cryptosystems (ECC) and RSA systems have been<br>
introduced. Most existing countermeasures against classical DPA<br>
attacks are vulnerable to these new DPA attacks which include<br>
refined power analysis attacks (RPA), zero-value point attacks<br>
(ZPA), and doubling attacks. The new attacks are different from<br>
classical DPA in that RPA uses a special point with a zero-value<br>
coordinate, while ZPA uses auxiliary registers to locate a zero<br>
value. So, Mamiya et al proposed a new countermeasure against RPA,<br>
ZPA, classical DPA and SPA attacks using a basic random initial<br>
point. His countermeasure works well when applied to ECC, but it has<br>
some disadvantages when applied to general exponentiation algorithms<br>
(such as RSA and ElGamal) due to an inverse computation. This paper<br>
presents an efficient and improved countermeasure against the above<br>
new DPA attacks by using a random blinding concept on the message<br>
different from Mamiya's countermeasure and show that our proposed<br>
countermeasure is secure against SPA based Yen's power analysis<br>
which can break Coron's simple SPA countermeasure as well as<br>
Mamiya's one. The computational cost of the proposed scheme is very<br>
low when compared to the previous methods which rely on Coron's<br>
simple SPA countermeasure. Moreover this scheme is a generalized<br>
countermeasure which can be applied to ECC as well as RSA system.</span>

<div class="indented"><b>Abstract:</b>
    <br><span class="fixed">This
paper presents a novel framework for generic construction of hybrid
encryption schemes which produces more efficient schemes than before. A
known framework introduced by Shoup combines a key encapsulation
mechanism (KEM) and a data encryption mechanism (DEM). While it is
believed that both of the components must be secure against chosen
ciphertext attacks, Kurosawa and Desmedt showed a particular example of
KEM that might not be CCA but can be securely combined with CCA DEM
yielding more efficient hybrid encryption scheme. There are also many
efficient hybrid encryption schemes in various settings that do not fit
to the framework. These facts serve as motivation to seek another
framework that yields more efficient schemes.<br>
<br>
In addition to the potential efficiency of the resulting schemes, our<br>
framework will provide insightful explanation about existing schemes<br>
that do not fit to the previous framework. This could result in finding
improvements for some schemes. Moreover, it allows immediate conversion
from a class of threshold public-key encryption to a hybrid one without
considerable overhead, which is not possible in the previous approach.<br>

    <br><span class="fixed">We present a formal model and a simple architecture for robust pseudorandom generation that ensures resilience in the face of an<br>
observer with partial knowledge/control of the generator's entropy
source. Our model and architecture have the following properties:<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Resilience: The generator's output looks random to an observer with
no knowledge of the internal state. This holds even if that observer
has complete control over data that is used to refresh the internal
state.<br>
<br>
2 Forward security: Past output of the generator looks random to an
observer, even if the observer learns the internal state at a later
time.<br>
<br>
3 Backward security/Break-in recovery: Future output of the generator
looks random, even to an observer with knowledge of the current state,
provided that the generator is refreshed with data of sufficient
entropy.<br>
<br>
<br>
Architectures such as above were suggested before. This work differs<br>
from previous attempts in that we present a formal model for robust<br>
pseudo-random generation, and provide a formal proof within this model<br>
for the security of our architecture. To our knowledge, this is the<br>
first attempt at a rigorous model for this problem.<br>
<br>
Our formal modeling advocates the separation of the *entropy
extraction* phase from the *output generation* phase. We argue that the
former is information-theoretic in nature, and could therefore rely on
combinatorial and statistical tools rather than on cryptography. On the
other hand, we show that the latter can be implemented using any
standard (non-robust) cryptographic PRG.<br>
<br>
We also discuss the applicability of our architecture for applications
such as /dev/(u)random in Linux and pseudorandom generation on
smartcards.<br>

    <br><span class="fixed">  We investigate the definition of statistical security (i.e.,<br>
  security against unbounded adversaries) in the framework of reactive<br>
  simulatability. This framework allows to formulate and analyze<br>
  multi-party protocols modularly by providing a composition theorem<br>
  for protocols. However, we show that the notion of statistical<br>
  security, as defined by Backes, Pfitzmann and Waidner for the<br>
  reactive simulatability framework, does not allow for secure<br>
  composition of protocols. This in particular invalidates the proof<br>
  of the composition theorem.<br>
<br>
  We give evidence that the reason for the non-composability of<br>
  statistical security is no artifact of the framework itself, but of<br>
  the particular formulation of statistical security. Therefore, we<br>
  give a modified notion of statistical security in the reactive<br>

  As to the best of our knowledge, no formal definition of statistical<br>

<div class="indented"><b>Abstract:</b>
    <br><span class="fixed">In the society increasingly concerned with the erosion of privacy,<br>
privacy-preserving techniques are becoming very important.<br>
Secret handshakes offer anonymous and unobservable authentication <br>
and serve as an important tool in the arsenal of privacy-preserving <br>
techniques. Relevant prior research focused on 2-party secret <br>
handshakes with one-time credentials, whereby two parties establish <br>
a secure, anonymous and unobservable communication channel only if <br>
they are members of the same group. <br>
<br>
This paper breaks new ground on two accounts: (1) it shows how <br>
to obtain secure and efficient secret handshakes with reusable <br>
credentials, and (2) it provides the first treatment of multi-party<br>
secret handshakes, whereby m&gt;=2 parties establish a secure, <br>
anonymous and unobservable communication channel only if they all<br>
belong to the same group. An interesting new issue encountered <br>
in multi-party secret handshakes is the need to ensure that all<br>
parties are distinct. (This is a real challenge since the <br>
parties cannot expose their identities.) We tackle this and <br>
other challenging issues in constructing GCD -- a flexible secret <br>
handshake framework. GCD can be viewed as a compiler that <br>
transforms three main building blocks: (1) a Group signature scheme, <br>
(2) a Centralized group key distribution scheme, and (3) a <br>
Distributed group key agreement scheme, into a secure <br>
multi-party secret handshake scheme.<br>
<br>
The proposed framework lends itself to multiple practical <br>
instantiations, and offers several novel and appealing features <br>
such as self-distinction and strong anonymity with reusable<br>
credentials. In addition to describing the motivation and <br>
step-by-step construction of the framework, this paper provides <br>
a security analysis and illustrates several concrete framework <br>
instantiations.</span>

(RO) model.  They also remarked that EDL can be turned into an <br>
off-line/on-line signature scheme using the technique of Shamir <br>
and Tauman, based on chameleon hash functions.<br>
<br>
In this paper, we propose a new signature scheme that also has a <br>
tight security reduction to CDH but whose resulting signatures <br>
are smaller than EDL signatures.  Further, similarly to the <br>
Schnorr signature scheme (but contrary to EDL), our signature is <br>
naturally efficient on-line: no additional trick is needed for <br>
the off-line phase and the verification process is unchanged.<br>
<br>
For example, in elliptic curve groups, our scheme results in a <br>
25% improvement on the state-of-the-art discrete-log based <br>
schemes, with the same security level.  This represents to date <br>
the most efficient scheme of any signature scheme with a tight <br>
security reduction in the discrete-log setting.</span>

<div class="indented"><b>Abstract:</b>
    <br><span class="fixed">In the setting of secure multiparty computation, a set of mutually<br>
distrustful parties wish to securely compute some joint function<br>
of their inputs. In the stand-alone case, it has been shown that<br>
{em every} efficient function can be securely computed.<br>
However, in the setting of concurrent composition, broad<br>
impossibility results have been proven for the case of no honest<br>
majority and no trusted setup phase. These results hold both for<br>
the case of general composition (where a secure protocol is run<br>
many times concurrently with arbitrary other protocols) and self<br>
composition (where a single secure protocol is run many times<br>
concurrently).<br>
<br>
In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of obtaining<br>
security in the concurrent setting, assuming that each party has a<br>
local clock and that these clocks proceed at approximately the<br>
same rate. We show that under this mild timing assumption, it is<br>
possible to securely compute {em any} multiparty functionality<br>
under concurrent emph{self} composition. We also show that it<br>
is possible to securely compute {em any} multiparty<br>
functionality under concurrent {em general} composition, as<br>
long as the secure protocol is run only with protocols whose<br>
messages are delayed by a specified amount of time. On the<br>
negative side, we show that it is impossible to achieve security<br>
under concurrent general composition with no restrictions<br>
whatsoever on the network (like the aforementioned delays), even<br>
in the timing model.</span>

<div class="indented"><b>Abstract:</b>
    <br><span class="fixed">Much of today's distributed computing takes place in a client/server model.<br>
Despite advances in fault tolerance -- in particular, replication and load<br>
distribution -- server overload remains to be<br>
a major problem. In the Web context, one of the main overload factors is the<br>
direct consequence of expensive Public Key operations performed by servers<br>
as part of each SSL handshake. Since most SSL-enabled servers use RSA,<br>
the burden of performing many costly decryption operations can be<br>
very detrimental to server performance. This paper examines a<br>
promising technique for re-balancing RSA-based client/server<br>
handshakes. This technique facilitates more favorable load distribution<br>
by requiring clients to perform more work (as part of encryption) and<br>
servers to perform commensurately less work, thus resulting in better<br>
SSL throughput.  Proposed techniques are based on careful adaptation of<br>
variants of Server-Aided RSA originally constructed by<br>
Matsumoto, et al. Experimental results demonstrate that<br>
suggested methods (termed Client-Aided RSA) can speed up processing<br>
by a factor of between 11 to 19, depending on the RSA key size. This represents<br>
a considerable improvement. Furthermore, proposed techniques can be a useful<br>
companion tool for SSL Client Puzzles in defense against DoS and DDoS attacks.</span>

message for a Receiver, in a way that the Receiver cannot convince<br>
a third party that such authentication (or any authentication) ever<br>

<br>
We point out a subtle definitional issue for deniability. In particular<br>
we propose the notion of {em forward deniability}, which requires that<br>
the authentications remain deniable even if the {em Sender} wants to later<br>
prove that she authenticated a message. We show that generic<br>
results where deniability is obtained by reduction to a computational<br>
zero-knowledge protocol for an NP-complete language<br>
do not achieve forward deniability.<br>
<br>
We then present two new approaches to the problem of deniable authentication.<br>
On the theoretical side, the novelty of our schemes is that they<br>
do not require the use of CCA-secure encryption (all previous known solutions<br>
did), thus showing a different generic approach to the problem of<br>
deniable authentication. On the practical side, these new approaches lead<br>
to more efficient protocols. As an added bonus, our<br>
protocols are forward deniable.</span>

    <br><span class="fixed">Radio
Frequency Identification (RFID) systems aim to identify objects in open
environments with neither physical nor visual contact. They consist of
transponders inserted into objects, of readers, and usually of a
database which contains information about the objects. The key point is
that authorised readers must be able to identify tags without an
adversary being able to trace them. Traceability is often
underestimated by advocates of the technology and sometimes exaggerated
by its detractors. Whatever the true picture, this problem is a reality
when it blocks the deployment of this technology and some companies,
faced with being boycotted, have already abandoned its use. Using
cryptographic primitives to thwart the traceability issues is an
approach which has been explored for several years. However, the
research carried out up to now has not provided satisfactory results as
no universal formalism has been defined. <br>
In this paper, we propose an adversarial model suitable for RFID
environments. We define the notions of existential and universal
untraceability and we model the access to the communication channels
from a set of oracles. We show that our formalisation fits the problem
being considered and allows a formal analysis of the protocols in terms
of traceability. We use our model on several well-known RFID protocols
and we show that most of them have weaknesses and are vulnerable to
traceability.</span>

Identifier (RFID) technology. Contactless smartcards are becoming<br>
increasingly popular, with applications like credit-cards,<br>
national-ID, passports, physical access. The security of such<br>
applications is clearly critical. A key feature of RFID-based systems<br>
is their very short range: typical systems are designed to operate at<br>
a range of ~10cm. In this study we show that contactless<br>
smartcard technology is vulnerable to relay attacks: An attacker can<br>
trick the reader into communicating with a victim smartcard that is<br>
very far away. A "low-tech" attacker can build a pick-pocket system<br>
that can remotely use a victim contactless smartcard, without the<br>
victim's knowledge. The attack system consists of two devices, which<br>
we call the "ghost" and the "leech". We discuss basic designs for<br>
the attacker's equipment, and explore their possible operating<br>
ranges. We show that the ghost can be up to 50m away from the card<br>
reader---3 orders of magnitude higher than the nominal range. We also<br>
show that the leech can be up to 50cm away from the the victim<br>
card. The main characteristics of the attack are: orthogonality to any<br>
