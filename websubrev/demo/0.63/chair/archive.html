<h1>Manage archive files</h1>
Use this page to generate an archive file that contains all the
submissions, so reviewers do not have to download each one individually.

<h2>Automatically creating archive files</h2>
This script will attempt to use the Archive_Tar package (which is part of
PEAR) to automatically generate the archive file. If this package is not
installed, it will then try to use the utility program <tt>tar</tt>, and
failing that it will try to use the program <tt>zip</tt>. 
<ul>
<li>If support for compression is installed on the server, then you
    can generate a gzipped tar file called <i>all_in_one.tgz</i> by
    <a href="archive1.html@makeTar=yes">following this link</a>.</li>

<li>If the link above does not work, you can try to generate a 
    non-compressed tar file called <i>all_in_one.tar</i> by
    <a href="archive1.html@makeTar=yes&amp;noZip=no">following this
    alternate link</a>.</li>
</ul>
You can test the resulting archive file by <a href="../review/index2.html">going to
the review page</a> and looking for a link to "Download submissions
in one file". That link will point to the file <i>all_in_one.tgz</i> if it
exists, and failing that it will first try <i>all_in_one.zip</i> and then
<i>all_in_one.tar</i>. (If none of these files exist, the link will not
show on the review page.)

<h2>Manually creating archive files</h2>
If the above methods for creating an archive file do not work, and if you
have administrative access to the server, you can manually create an archive
file in one of these three formats and put it in the submission directory
(which is <code>C:/Program Files/xampp/htdocs/websubrev/trunk/webtree/subs</code>). The file must be called either
<i>all_in_one.tgz</i>, <i>all_in_one.zip</i>, or <i>all_in_one.tar</i>.
<br/><br/>
As a last resort, if you do not have have administrative access to the
server, you can download all the submission files to your local machine,
then create the archive file locally and upload it to the server. The
extension of the local archive file must be either .tgz, .tar, or .zip
for this method to work.<br/> 
<form action="archive2.html" enctype="multipart/form-data" method=post>
<input type=hidden name="MAX_FILE_SIZE" value=200000000>
Local archive file:<input name=sub_archive size=50 type="file">
<input name=submit type=submit value="Upload">
</form>

<h2>Removing archive files</h2>
If you want to delete archive files, follow one of these links to 
	 <a href="archive3.html">delete all_in_one.tgz</a>,
	 <a href="archive3.html">delete all_in_one.zip</a>,
or       <a href="archive3.html">delete all_in_one.tar</a>
(if they exist).
