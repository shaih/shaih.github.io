<h1>Demo of Web Submission and Review Software (0.63)</h1>
Here you can find a static HTML demo of version 0.63 of the Web Submission
and Review Software. This demo includes almost all the pages that are
available in this software.  You can click through these pages to see of
how the software behaves in the different situations during the submission
and review process. 
To start the demo, choose between the following views:
<dl>
<dt><b>Administrator/Program chair:</b></dt>
<dd><a href="chair/initialize.html">Initial setup of the software</a></dd>
<dd><a href="chair/index1.html">Submission-site management</a></dd>
<dd><a href="chair/index2.html">Review-site management</a></dd>
<dd><a href="chair/index3.html">Final-version submission management</a></dd>
<dd><a href="chair/index5.html">After camera-ready deadline</a>
<br/><br/>
</dd>
<dt><b>Program-committee member:</b></dt>
<dd><a href="review/index0.html">Initial access to site</a></dd>
<dd><a href="review/index1.html">Individual-review phase</a></dd>
<dd><a href="review/index2.html">Discussion phase</a>
<br/><br/>
</dd>
<dt><b>Submission author:</b></dt>
<dd><a href="submit/index1.html">Paper submission</a></dd>
<dd><a href="submit/index2.html">Final-version submission</a></dd>
</dl>
Note that these views are not entirely separate: pages from one view
are sometimes also accessible via links from other views. Also, remember
that this demo is made entirely of static HTML pages, so it will ignore
any input that you specify in the various forms.
