<h2>Short Statement</h2>
The IACR is my professional home, where I publish most of my work. Over the years I held several board-level roles, chaired conferences, and contributed in other ways. As a director, I will use my experience to help make the changes we need while maintaining out vibrant research culture.

<h2>Longer Statement</h2>
<p>I have been an active member of the IACR since my first CRYPTO in 1995. I am an IACR fellow, and over the years I served as membership secretary, director, vice president, the chair of the TCC steering committee, and a program chair of TCC and CRYPTO. I also contributed in other ways to the services that IACR provided to its members (such as my websubrev system that the IACR was using until a few years ago).</p>
<p>
The IACR has weathered the COVID crisis and managed to keep supporting our research and our community. The last few years taught us new ways of working, we now need to take these lessons and use them to better our services in a post-pandemic world. We need to find a new balance between in-person meetings and remote attendance, redefine the format and roles of our publication venues, find ways to support all our members in an increasingly fractured world, and look for new ways to grow our community without compromising on the culture that made it so successful.</p>
<p>
As a director I will use my experience to help strike a balance between changes we need and the spirit that we want to maintain, with our unique blend of mathematics, computer science, and engineering. My first priority as a director will be setting policies to help maintain the high quality of our research, even as we explore new directions. I will also work to enhance the services that the IACR offers to the cryptology research community and protect our ability to support open research in cryptology.</p>
