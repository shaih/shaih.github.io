<h2>Short Statement</h2>
The IACR is my professional home. This is where I publish most of my work, and over the years I held several board-level roles, chaired conferences, and contributed in other ways. As the vice president I will keep contributing to the IACR, helping us maintain our vibrant research culture.

<h2>Longer Statement</h2>
<p>I have been an active member of the IACR since my first CRYPTO in 1995. I am an IACR fellow, and over the years I served as membership secretary and director, as the chair of the TCC steering committee, and as a program chair of TCC and CRYPTO. I also wrote and maintained the websubrev system that the IACR has been using in recent years for submission and review of papers in its conferences.
</p>
<p>I hope to keep contributing to the IACR and to the community that it serves. As the vice president I will strive to ensure that we maintain our vibrant research culture with its unique blend of mathematics, computer science, and engineering.</p>
</p>
My first priority will be setting policies to help maintain the high quality of our research, even as we explore new models for our venues and publications. I will also work to enhance the services that the IACR offers to the cryptology research community and protect our ability to support open research in cryptology.
